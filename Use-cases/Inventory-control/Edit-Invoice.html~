    <h1>Edit Invoice</h1>
    <h2>Basic Path</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Include "View Invoices".</p></li>
      <li><p>The Inventory Manager selects one of the invoices
	  to edit.</p></li>

      <li><p>The software retrieves the list of possible vendors.</p></li>
      <li><p>The software retreives the list of possible stockrooms.</p></li>
      <li><p>The software retrieves the possible shipping methods.</p></li>
      <li><p>The software retrieves the invoice's information.</p></li>
      <li><p>For the following prompts, the software uses the invoice
	  information for defaults.</p></li>
      <li><p>The software prompts the Inventory Manager for the invoices number,
	  invoices PO, invoice's shipping datetime, stockroom, vendor, and
	  when the invoice was received.</p></li>
      <li><p>The software checks that the invoice's PO is not used by another invoice.</p></li>
      <li><p>The software checks that the invoice's POS is not linked to a prior order.</p></li>
      <li><p>The software checks that the invoice's invoice number is not used by any other
	  invoice of the same vendor.</p></li>
      <li><p>For each product on the invoice</p></li>
      <ol>
	<li><p>The software will allow multiple ways to enter the products.</p></li>
	<li><p>The software manager may enter the product's description. If parts of the
	    description are unknown he or she may hit tab and the description will
	    auto expand to the correct desription with prefix, or if there are multiple,
	    products allow the Inventory Manager to select between them. (Link on Emacs).
	    If shift-tab is used, all possible substrings with the products are used.</p></li>
	<li><p>The software manager may enter the UPC, either by hand or bar code.
	    If the UPC is not found, the software will allow the Inventory Manager
	    to create a new product. After the product is created the software will
	    use that product for the entry. If only 6 or 3 digits of the UPC are entered
	    the software tries to find the correct product using theses as the last digits.
	    If multiple products are found they are shown the Inventory Manager who may select
	    them. The first letter of the vendor followed by the last 6 or last 3 digits may
	    also be used to differrentiate between them as well.</p></li>
	<li><p>The software manager may enter the product's SKU.</p></li>
	<li><p>Check that the product is uniquely identified.</p></li>
	<li><p>After uniquely identifying the product, the software retrieves the default unit type
	    of the product.</p></li>
	<li><p>The software prompts the Inventory for the received quantity and unit type,using
	    the default unit type.</p></li>
	<li><p>As we are not editing an invoice from the pO, the shipped quantity is always equal
	    to the ordered quantity.</p></li>
	<li><p>The software checks that the received quantity is an integer, greater than 0.</p></li>
	<li><p>The software allows the Inventory Manager to remove a previously added invoice.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <li><p>The software prompts the Inventory Manager whether to update the invoice.</p></li>
