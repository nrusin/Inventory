    <h2>Basic Path</h2>
    <div class="basic-path">
    <ol>
      <li><p>The use case begins when the Inventory Manager selects "Add Invoice".</p></li>
      <li><p>The software retrieves the possible vendors.</p></li>
      <li><p>The software checks that there is at least one vendor.</p></li>
      <li><p>If there is only one vendor then the software automatically picks that one
	     vendor to use for the add invoice.</p>
      <li><p>The software retrieves the possible stockrooms.</p></li>
      <li><p>The software checks that there is at least one stockroom.</p></li>
      <li><p>If there is only one stockroom then the software automatically picks that one
	     stockroom.</p></li>
      <li><p>The software retrieves the possible shipping methods.</p></li>
      <li><p>The software prompts the Inventory Manager for the invoice number, invoice's PO,
	  invoice's shipping datetime, stockroom, vendor and when the invoice was received.</p></li>
      <li><p>The shipping method, invoice number, invoice PO, shipping datetime
	     can be left empty. </p></li>
      <li><p>The software checks that the invoice's PO is not used by another invoice.</p></li>
      <li><p>The software checks that the invoice's PO is not linked to a prior order.</p></li>
      <li><p>The software checks that the invoice's invoice number is not used by any other
	     invoice of the same vendor.</p></li>
      <li><p>For each product that the Inventory Manager wants to add to the invoice</p></li>
	<ol>
	  <li><p>The software allows multiple ways to enter the products.</p></li>
	  <li><p>The software manager may enter the product's description. If parts of the
	      description are unknown he or she may hit tab and the description will
	      auto expand to the correct description with prefix, or if there are multiple
	      products allow the Inventory Manager to select between them. (Like on Emacs). If
	      shift-tab is used, all possible substrings with the products are used. </p></li>
	  <li><p>The software manager may enter the UPC, either by hand or bar code. If the
	      UPC is not found, the software will allow the Inventory Manager to create
	      a new product. After the product is created the software will\ use that
	      product for the entry. If only 6 or 3 digits of the UPC are entered the software
	      tries to find the correct product using these as the last digits. If multiple products
	      are found they are shown the Inventory Manager who may select them. The first letter of the
	      vendor followed by the last 6 or last 3 digits may also be used to differentiate between
	      them as well. </p></li>
	  <li><p>The software manager may enter the product's SKU.</p></li>
	  <li><p>The software checks that the product is uniquely identified.</p></li>
	  <li><p>After uniquely identifying the product, the software retrieves
	         the default unit type of the product. </p></li>
	  <li><p>The software prompts the Inventory Manager for the received quantity
	      and unit type, using the default unit type.</p></li>
	  <li><p>As we are not creating the invoice from the PO, the shipped quantity is always
	         equal to the ordered quantity.</p></li>
	  <li><p>The software checks that the received quantity is an integer,
	         greater than 0.</p></li>
	  <li><p>The software allows the Inventory Manager to remove
	         a previously added product.</p></li>
	  
	    
	</ol>
      <li><p>The software prompts the Inventory Manager whether to add the invoice.</p></li>
    </ol>

      <ol>

	    PO.</p></li>
